2. Flute Count Guidelines
 Aluminum: 2–3 flutes
 Steel: 4 flutes
 Stainless: 4–6 flutes
 Cast Iron: 4 flutes
 Brass: 2–4 (neutral rake)
 Plastics: 1–2 (O-flute)
3. Depth of Cut (Starting Points)
 Axial (depth): ~½ tool diameter
 Radial (stepover): ~½ tool diameter
 Reduce for harder materials or smaller tools
4. Notes
 Start low and increase chip load until tool runs efficiently without chatter
 Carbide can handle ~2–3× HSS chip load if rigid
 Use coolant/oil/air as appropriate
