| Material | Recommended Fluids | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Aluminum | Kerosene, WD‑40, IPA, commercial aluminum fluids | Prevents built‑up edge, improves finish |
| Brass | Generally **dry**; light oil if needed | Machines cleanly, minimal fluid required |
| Bronze | Sulfurized/light cutting oil, soluble oil | Lubrication reduces tool wear |
| Copper | Kerosene, light oil, soluble oil | Prevents gumming/sticking |
| Steel (mild/low carbon) | Soluble oil, sulfurized cutting oil | Cooling + lubrication reduce wear |
| Tool Steel | Heavy‑duty cutting oil, soluble oil | Helps prevent overheating and tool wear |
| High Speed Steel (workpiece) | Cutting oil or soluble oil | Needed for harder alloys |
| Stainless Steel | Sulfurized cutting oil, soluble oil with EP additives | Prevents work‑hardening, reduces wear |
| Cast Iron | **Dry** or air blast | Graphite provides natural lubrication; fluids create sludge |
| Acetal (Delrin) | **Dry** or air blast | Chips clear easily; fluids unnecessary |
| Titanium | Flood coolant, soluble oil with EP additives | Prevents galling/work‑hardening; heavy cooling required |
