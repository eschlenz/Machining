Material
Recommended Fluids
Notes
Aluminum
Kerosene, WD-40, IPA, Commercial
Aluminum Fluids
Prevents built-up edge, improves finish
Brass
Generally dry; light oil if needed
Machines cleanly, minimal fluid required
Bronze
Sulfurized/light cutting oil, soluble oil
Lubrication reduces tool wear
Copper
Kerosene, light oil, soluble oil
Prevents gumming/sticking
Steel (mild/low
carbon)
Soluble oil, sulfurized cutting oil
Cooling and lubrication reduce wear
Tool Steel
Heavy-duty cutting oil, soluble oil
Helps prevent overheating and tool wear
High Speed Steel
(workpiece)
Cutting oil or soluble oil
Necessary for harder alloys
Stainless Steel
Sulfurized cutting oil, soluble oil with
EP additives
Prevents work-hardening, reduces tool wear
Cast Iron
Dry or air blast
Graphite provides natural lubrication; fluids
create messy sludge
Acetal (Delrin)
Dry or air blast
Chips clear easily; fluids unnecessary
Titanium
Flood coolant, soluble oil with EP
additives
Prevents galling and work-hardening, requires
heavy cooling
