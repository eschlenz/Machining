| Material / Tool | Best Uses | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Emery Paper | General sanding, deburring, rust removal | Wears quickly on hard alloys; versatile |
| Scotch‑Brite Pads | Blending finishes, cleaning oxidation, surface prep | Non‑woven, reusable, less aggressive than sandpaper |
| Steel Wool | Fine finishing/polishing, cleaning rust/finishes | Can shed fibers that rust; avoid near electricals/food |
| Polishing Compounds | Mirror finishes on metals/plastics | Use with buffing wheels/cloths; match compound to metal |
| Grinding Wheels | Heavy stock removal, shaping, sharpening | Heat generation; use wheel type matched to material |
| Grinding Stones | Detail grinding, tool sharpening, deburring | For Dremel/die grinders; avoid side‑loading |
| Strops (leather) | Final honing/razor edges | Load with compound (e.g., green chromium oxide) |
| Buffing Wheels | Final luster polishing | Use with compounds; secure work to avoid catch |
| Flap Discs | Aggressive sanding, weld blending, shaping | On angle grinders; grind + sand in one |
| Wire Wheels/Brushes | Rust/paint/scale removal; weld cleaning | Can scratch; wear eye protection |
| Lapping Plates | Precision flat polishing | Use abrasive slurry; very fine flatness/finish work |
