# Cutting Tool Compatibility by Material

| Material | HSS | Cobalt HSS | Carbide | Ceramic/CBN | Notes |
|----------|-----|------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Aluminum 6061 | Excellent | Yes | Optimal | No | HSS fine; carbide gives longer life at high speeds. |
| Aluminum 7075 | Yes | Yes | Optimal | No | Stronger; carbide preferred for production. |
| Brass (Free Cutting) | Excellent | Yes | Yes | No | Very easy to machine; sharp HSS works well. |
| Bronze (Phosphor) | Yes | Yes | Optimal | No | Tough; carbide gives best results. |
| Bronze (Aluminum) | Yes | Yes | Optimal | No | Harder than phosphor; carbide recommended. |
| Copper (Pure) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Prone to built-up edge; use sharp tools. |
| Mild Steel 1018 | Limited | Better | Optimal | No | Cobalt extends life; carbide preferred. |
| Medium Carbon 1045 | Limited | Recommended | Optimal | No | HSS struggles; carbide much better. |
| Alloy Steel 4140/4142 PH | Limited | Yes | Optimal | No | Carbide strongly preferred. |
| Tool Steel O1 / A2 | Limited | Recommended | Optimal | No | Carbide for hardened states. |
| >45 HRC Tool Steel | No | No | Coated Carbide | Optimal | Requires CBN or ceramics. |
| 303 Stainless | Yes | Recommended | Optimal | No | Free machining; friendly stainless. |
| 304 Stainless | Poor | Better | Optimal | No | Gummy; carbide strongly preferred. |
| 316 Stainless | Poor | Better | Optimal | No | Even tougher than 304. |
| 416 Stainless | Good | Yes | Optimal | No | One of the most machinable stainless grades. |
| Gray Cast Iron | Wear | Yes | Optimal | Sometimes | Carbide excels; ceramics for high-speed dry cuts. |
| Ductile Cast Iron | Limited | Yes | Optimal | Sometimes | Similar to gray cast iron. |
| Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) | No | Limited | Optimal | Aerospace | Carbide with coolant is standard; ceramics in aerospace. |
| Acetal (Delrin) | Excellent | Yes | Yes | No | Any tooling works; keep sharp. |
| Nylon | Excellent | Yes | Yes | No | Use sharp edges; avoid rubbing heat. |
| Acrylic / Polycarbonate | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Prone to melting; sharp tools and light passes. |
