# Cutting Tool Compatibility by Material

| Material | HSS | Cobalt HSS | Carbide | Ceramic/CBN | Notes |
|----------|-----|------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Aluminum 6061 | ✅ Excellent | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | HSS fine; carbide gives longer life at high speeds. |
| Aluminum 7075 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Stronger; carbide preferred for production. |
| Brass (Free Cutting) | ✅ Excellent | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Very easy to machine; sharp HSS works well. |
| Bronze (Phosphor) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Tough; carbide gives best results. |
| Bronze (Aluminum) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Harder than phosphor; carbide recommended. |
| Copper (Pure) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Prone to built-up edge; use sharp tools. |
| Mild Steel 1018 | ⚠ Gummy | ✅ Better | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Cobalt extends life; carbide preferred. |
| Medium Carbon 1045 | ⚠ Limited | ✅ Recommended | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | HSS struggles; carbide much better. |
| Alloy Steel 4140/4142 PH | ⚠ | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Carbide strongly preferred. |
| Tool Steel O1 / A2 | ⚠ | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Carbide for hardened states. |
| >45 HRC Tool Steel | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠ Coated Carbide | ✅ Optimal | Requires CBN or ceramics. |
| 303 Stainless | ✅ | ✅ Recommended | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Free machining; friendly stainless. |
| 304 Stainless | ⚠ Poor | ✅ Better | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Gummy; carbide strongly preferred. |
| 316 Stainless | ⚠ Poor | ✅ Better | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | Even tougher than 304. |
| 416 Stainless | ✅ Good | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ❌ | One of the most machinable stainless grades. |
| Gray Cast Iron | ⚠ Wear | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ✅ Sometimes | Carbide excels; ceramics for high-speed dry cuts. |
| Ductile Cast Iron | ⚠ | ✅ | ✅ Optimal | ✅ Sometimes | Similar to gray cast iron. |
| Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) | ❌ | ⚠ Limited | ✅ Optimal | ✅ Aerospace | Carbide with coolant is standard; ceramics in aerospace. |
| Acetal (Delrin) | ✅ Excellent | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Any tooling works; keep sharp. |
| Nylon | ✅ Excellent | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Use sharp edges; avoid rubbing heat. |
| Acrylic / Polycarbonate | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Prone to melting; sharp tools and light passes. |
