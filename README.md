# Useful Machining Quick Reference Documents

This is a collection of quick reference documents I have created (with the help of AI) to aid me on my hobby machining journey. I was finding that the "Machinist Handbook" (bible) was just too verbose for my needs. I prefer more focused cheat sheets like those found here.

SPECIAL NOTE: One document in particular, [Tap Drill Sizes](TapDrillSizes.pdf), is courtesy of LittleMachineShop.com. All credit to this wonderful document goes to them. They actually have a larger set of reference material that can be found [here](https://littlemachineshop.com/info/business_resources.php?ID=1343147249&CAT=1).
