# Useful Machining Quick Reference Documents

This is a collection of quick reference documents I have created (with the help of AI) to aid me on my hobby machining journey. I was finding that the "Machinist Handbook" (bible) was just too verbose for my needs. I prefer more focused cheat sheets like those found here.

The information found here should _generally_ be correct based on my own (limited) knowledge. However, use at your own discretion. AI likes to hallucinate and just make crap up sometimes. Double check information found here against another source if you are unsure.

SPECIAL NOTE: One document in particular, [Tap Drill Sizes](TapDrillSizes.pdf), is courtesy of LittleMachineShop.com. All credit to this wonderful document goes to them. They actually have a larger set of reference material that can be found [here](https://littlemachineshop.com/info/business_resources.php?ID=1343147249&CAT=1).
